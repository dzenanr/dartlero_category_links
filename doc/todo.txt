To Do

- not used a two-way data binding for editing a category or a web link;
  also, not used HTML5 forms with required and pattern (Spiral 08?)
- pressing the Links button a 2nd time makes the component disappear, 
  and a links button from another category can be pressed (not entirely ok).

+ add category to link
+ note that all ids of all components must be unique within a page
